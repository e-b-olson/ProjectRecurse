Building a Platform to Build the Platform
  
  
## The Experiment
  
This is an experiment.  The goal is to build something.  Something cool.  I don't know what it is yet.  So we'll just take it one step at a time.  There are three steps:
  
```
0. Add an item to the TODO list
1. Do the item on the TODO list
3. Build the rest of the project
```
  
Okay.  Seems simple enough.  So.  Let's do this!
  
  
## The TODO List
  
- [x] Create a repo for the project
- [ ] Decide what to do next
